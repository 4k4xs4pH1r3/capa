# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow will initiate a Contrast Scan on your built artifact, and subsequently upload the results SARIF to Github.
# Because Contrast Scan is designed to run against your deployable artifact, you need to build an artifact that will be passed to the Contrast Scan Action.
# Contrast Scan currently supports Java, JavaScript and .NET artifacts.
# For more information about the Contrast Scan GitHub Action see here: https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrastscan-action

# Pre-requisites:
# All Contrast related account secrets should be configured as GitHub secrets to be passed as inputs to the Contrast Scan Action.
# The required secrets are CONTRAST_API_KEY, CONTRAST_ORGANIZATION_ID and CONTRAST_AUTH_HEADER.
